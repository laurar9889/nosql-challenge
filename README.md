# nosql-challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
In order to do so, you will find 2 jupyter notebooks, and the CSV file containing all data:
1. NoSQL_setup_starter which aims to connect the database and perfom some coding to find relevant information.
2. NOSQL_analysis_starter which has queries that aim to answer 4 main questions that were provided by UK Food Standards Agency. The answer to each question can be found below it, and each query will show how I came to each conclusion.
